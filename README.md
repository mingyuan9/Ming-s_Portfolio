## Project 1: E-commerce & Website Analytics ##

Objective: 
This project was created by Maven Analytics. The objective was to act as an eCommerce Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online retailer which has launched their products, to understand website performance.

My goal was:
  - Analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches
  - Analyze most-viewed pages and landing page performance, and use conversion funnel analysis to understand how many users continue/abondon at each step
  - Analyze seasonality and business patterns to help the company maximize efficiency and anticipate future trends
  - Analyze customer behavior to understand which products users are most likely to purchase together
